        <h1>Welcome To JUJUTSU Service</h1>
        <p>
          From a humble beginning of local services, our transport system
          encompasses all reachable areas of Bangladesh and also beyond the
          border, extending our reach to Kolkata in India. We worked hard and
          honest, we put our vision forward and explored ways and means to
          continuously improve passenger comfort, and as a result, we were able
          to introduce the 1st ever Air- Conditioned bus services in Bangladesh.
          We take pride in mentioning that our fleet of buses includes the most
          luxurious models of VOLVO and SCANIA Imported from Europe, which
          provide the ultimate in passenger comfort and safety. The company at
          present operates more then 60 (Sixty) buses on schedule routes
          employing over 200 trained staff and safely transporting over a
          million passengers a year
